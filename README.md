I'm a full-stack software engineer with a background in the tech industry in Japan. I have a passion for doing difficult things and building apps.


At the beginning of 2024, I decided to continue my journey in IT that I started at University, and change career by joining an advanced software engineering course in Tokyo at Code Chrysalis - from which I have recently graduated.


I enjoy working in teams in tandem with pair programming to build intuitive apps, from the initial idea to deployment stage and see myself as being a self-starter/learner, capable of working with any programming language needed to complete a project.


So far my experience has covered:

Frontend: React / Next.js / TypeScript / Tailwind

Backend: NodeJS / ExpressJS / REST API / Ruby on Rails

Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB


Currently, as a hobby I'm re-building an existing backend of my app in Go: https://poipoi.vercel.app/. I have built the app with 6 other people, where I worked as a Product Owner and Full-stack Engineer.
